# KPI Automation (No API key)

This runs your aggregator, maps Bioguide â†’ GovTrack, and writes site-ready files.

## Files
- scripts/build_kpis.py
- scripts/map_bioguide_to_govtrack.py
- .github/workflows/build-kpis-python.yml

## Use
1) Put these files in your repo root alongside your `capitol_league_rollcall_aggregate.py`.
2) Push to `main`. The Action writes `dist/kpis.csv` and `dist/kpis.json` nightly and on push.
3) Point the site to:
   ?kpi=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/dist/kpis.csv
